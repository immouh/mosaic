 * the ERROR status indicates that the number of black (or white) squares in the

 * met. The SATISFIED status indicates that the number of black squares in the
 * neighborhood is equal to the numerical square constraint, and that the other
 * squares are white, i.e. there are no more EMPTY squares in the 3x3
 * neighborhood. Finally, the status UNSATISFIED indicates that the numerical
 * constraint has not yet been satisfied, but may still be. In this case, there
